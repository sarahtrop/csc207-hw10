Lucy Evans	Lucy is the precocious daughter of the owner of the Bombay Company, and met Eliot at Cambridge where she studied journalism. She uprooted her entire life for him, moving to this tiny Welsh town because he was mad, and she needed to be close. She looks devastated, sitting on the bed playing with her ring, you can tell she hasn't slept for a few days.	Eliot may have been crazy, but he was still the man I loved. I've known him since we were in university, and I never stopped being in awe of his intellect.Even when the madness drove him out of his mind. His father did the same thing you know, in the same way. It's too awful to think about. If you'll excuse me, I need to be alone.	Why can't you let me have my peace! My husband is DEAD.	15
Khan	Khan was Eliot's best friend and his student. Eliot taught Khan the ways of the golden spiral, and the four trances of Japanese spiritualism.	I looked up to Eliot, considered him the foremost scholar on our occult pursuits. Mala has said I seemed half-drunk in love when I spent time with him, and it wouldn't surprise me. The man was charasmatic, incredible to watch, and smart as a whip. Even as the illness set in. Please ask Lucy, she knows more than I do.	Didn't you hear me! Go find Lucy. She knows more than I do. All I know is that Eliot was working on a cure for paranoid schizophrenia. I guess we'll never know if he was on to something real.	15
Dr. Mala Khan	Mala is a doctor from Mauritius, married to Eliot's old friend from Cambridge. She seems friendly enough, and not terribly affected by what has happened to Eliot.	Eliot was a mess head, I always knew he was bad for my husband. I recommended my husband drop him, like a brick, but he wouldn't listen to me. And now look where we are.	I don't have anything else to tell you. Please go bother someone else.	10
