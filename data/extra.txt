At one point in time, Eliot believed most of his friends were agents of hostile powers, both Earthly and extra-terrestrial. Khan was an invader from Mars, one of many, who sneaked into Britain when certain essential forms of vigilance had been relaxed. You see, Martians have great gifts of mimicry, so they can fool yuman beans into believing they are beans of the same stripe, and they breed like fruit flies on a pile of rotten bananas.
Sometimes he was self aware, accepting that he was mad. He believed he was on the mend, starting work on the Owen Glendower book which worked fine as long as he stayed of the occult stuff. 
Eliot told Khan he was working on a simple cure for paranoid schizophrenia, in correspondence with the best men in the country. He said they agreed he'd hit on something completely new, and it was just a matter of time before they came up with the goods.
One night Eliot woke up at three a.m., convinced of a presence downstairs of something absolutely evil. He picked up his Swiss army knife, and descended, stark naked, to investigate. The electricity wasn't working. As he neared the kitchen, he felt artically cold and all the lights went crazy, switching themselves on and off.
Khan found it impossible to let go of Eliot's memory, perhaps because he knew that the seductive arcana which drove Eliot Crane out of his mind almost ensnared him as well. Under his friend's informal tutelage, he studied numerology and palmistry and memorised an Indian spell for flying. He was taught the verses that conjured up the Devil, Shaitan, and how to draw the beast that would keep the Beast 666 confined.
